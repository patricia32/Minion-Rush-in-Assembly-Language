# Minion-Rush-in-Assembly-Language

Simple Minion Rush game designed using assembly. I manually created every item from the game by setting codified bits: the Minion, bananas, obstacles, letters, digits etc.

Some features of the game:
  - the player has two extra lives before he loses the game
  - there are two types of bananas - the simple one worths 10 points and the triple one 25 points
  - when the Minion is hit by an obstacle the user loses a life or loses the game.
  - it is slightly customizable as the player can set the speed of obstacles and bananas: low, medium or fast. 

The game works using the mouse, the user has to click on the left of the Minion for a left move and on the right for a right move.

The fall of the bananas and obstacles and the Minion's moves are implemented by redrawing the items and covering the last one with a simple blue rectangle.
