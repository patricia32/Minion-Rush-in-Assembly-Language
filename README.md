# Minion-Rush-in-Assembly-Language

Simple Minion Rush game designed using assembly. I manually created every item from the game by setting codified bits: the Minion, bananas, obstacles, letters, digits etc.
The game works using the mouse, the user has to click on the left of the Minion for a left move and on the right for a right move.

The fall of the bananas and obstacles and the Minion's moves are implemented by redrawing the items and covering the last one with a simple blue rectangle.
